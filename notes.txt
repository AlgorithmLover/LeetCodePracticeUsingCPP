1.solution 2015 11 17 find duplicate number
  solution 1 from the perspective of numbers, use binary search on these nums to eliminate impossible choices.
  solution 2 a little bit tricky use 
			slow: x+y 
			fast: 2x+2y and we can figure out that y<=c
			x-1 = k*c - y -1 the node before the entrance of the ring 
			what a genius solution

2.solution 2015 11 18 range sum array 
  solution use map to save index,deltaValue, use sum to save sum, and keep vector for nums
           when map.size square is about array size, we rebuild sum
   time complexity O(sqrt(n))
