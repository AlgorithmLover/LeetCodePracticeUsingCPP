solution 2015 11 17 find duplicate number
  solution 1 from the perspective of numbers, use binary search on these nums to eliminate impossible choices.
  solution 2 a little bit tricky use 
			slow: x+y 
			fast: 2x+2y and we can figure out that y<=c
			x-1 = k*c - y -1 the node before the entrance of the ring 
			what a genius solution
